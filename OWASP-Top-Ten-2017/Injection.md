# Injection

## SQL Injection

* SQL injection also known as SQLi is an injection based web security vulnerability, which occurs as a result of non moderated SQL queries made by the web application to the backend or the SQL database .
* These unrestricted SQL queries often lead to retrieval of confidential data which is not usually described in the application's routing
* SQLi can be further leveraged to compromise the backend via landing a shell in the Database and DDOS if the query takes too long to process or ends up corrupting the Database
